# Testing

It is too often the case that code used for automating systems does not have the same attention for testing as application code. DevOps teams are often small and under tight deadlines. Such code is also hard to test, since it is meant to automate large systems, and proper isolation for testing is nontrivial.

However, testing is one of the best ways to increase code quality. It helps make code more maintainable in many ways. It also lowers defect rates. For code where defects can often mean total system outage, since it often touches all the parts of the system, this is important.
