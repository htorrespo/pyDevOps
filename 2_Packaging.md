# Packing

Much of dealing with Python in the real world is dealing with third-party packages. For a long time, the situation was not good. Things have improved dramatically, however. It is important to understand which “best practices” are antiquated rituals, which ones are based on faulty assumptions but have some merit, and which are actually good ideas.

When dealing with packaging, there are two ways to interact. One is to be a “consumer,” wanting to use the functionality from a package. Another is to be the “producer,” publishing a package. These describe, usually, different development tasks, not different people.

It is important to have a solid understanding of the “consumer” side of packages before moving to “producing.” If the goal of a package publisher is to be useful to the package user, it is crucial to imagine the “last mile” before starting to write a single line of code.
